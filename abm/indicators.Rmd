> Formal definitions of field normalized citation indicators and their implementation at KTH Royal Institute of Technology

# Introduction

This document describes the calculation of bibliometric indicators based
on field normalization in the bibliometric database at KTH (Bibmet),
which is based on Web of Science data. The indicators are described in
Part 1 and aspects regarding implementation in the KTH database are
addressed in Part 2.

The following indicators are defined in this document:

-   mean field normalized citation rate (cf)

-   top10% publications (ptop10%)

-   mean field normalized journal impact (jcf)

-   proportion publications in the 20% most frequently cited journals in
    the field (jtop20%)

# Part 1 Definitions

This document treats the case, in which fractional counts are used in
the calculations of indicator values. In case whole counts should be
used in the calculations, *a~i~* in Eq. (1) below is set to unity.

Let A be a unit of analysis, and *n* the number of publications for A.
Let *r~i~* be the number of authors of the *i*th publication for A. Let
*a~i~* be the *fraction* A has of the *i*th publication. We consider two
cases.

(**1**) A is an organization. We treat two subcases. (**1.1**) *a~i~* is
the *author* fraction A has of the *i*th publication and is defined as

where *m~i~* is the number of authors affiliated to A regarding the
*i*th publication, and *s~j~* the number of affiliations of the *j*th of
these A authors. Note that the right-hand side in Eq. (1) is equal to
when each A author has exactly one affiliation. (**1.2**) *a~i~* is the
*organization* fraction A has of the *i*th publication and is defined as
the number of occurrences of A's name in the address field of the *i*th
publication divided by the total number organization name occurrences in
the address field in question.

(**2**) A is an individual author. *a~i~* is the *author* fraction A has
of the *i*th publication and is in this case defined as.

**1.1 Mean field normalized citation rate**

We define the *mean field normalized citation rate* for A, *mcf*(A), as

\(2\)

where *q~i~* (*c~i~*) is the number of subject categories (the citation
rate) of the *i*th publication for A, *m~iq~* is the number of
publications, with the same publication year and of the same document
type as the *i*th publication for A, in the *q*th subject category of
the *i*th publication of A, and *c~j~* (*F~j~*) the citation rate of the
*j*th of these publications (the number of subject categories of the
*j*th of these publications). *µ~iq~* is the *field reference value*
that the citation rate of the *i*th publication, *c~i~*, is normalized
against regarding the *q*th subject category of the publication, and the
normalization gives rise to a *field normalized citation rate* for the
publication.

**1.2. ptop10%**

We define *ptop10%* for A, *ptop10%(*A), as

\(3\)

where *q~i~* (*c~i~*) is the number of subject categories (the citation
rate) of the *i*th publication for A, () the proportion
publications--with respect to the citation distribution, which concerns
publications with the same publication year and of the same document
type as the *i*th publication for A, and belonging to the *q*th subject
category of this publication--with less than *c~i~* (*c~i~* + 1)
citations.[^1] is the fraction of the *i*th publication with which the
publication is assigned to the 10% most cited publications. Observe that
this fraction is weighted by 1/*q~i~*, i.e., by the fraction of the
publication that belongs to the *q*th subject category. The approach to
assign fractions of publications to the (for instance) 10% most cited
publications is described and discussed by Waltman and Schreiber (2013).

**1.3 Mean field normalized journal impact**

We define the *mean field normalized journal impact* for A, *mjcf*(A),
as

\(4\)

where *jcf~i~* is the *mean field normalized citation rate of the
journal*, say *J~i~*, *of the i*th *publication*, *p~i~* the number of
publications in *J~i~*, *c~j~* the citation rate of the *j*th
publication in *J~i~*, say *P~j~*, *F~ij~* the number of subject
categories of *P~j~*, *m~jq~* the number of publications, with the same
publication year and of the same document type as *P~j~*, in the *q*th
subject category of *P~j~*, and *c~k~* (*F~k~*) the citation rate (the
number of subject categories) of the *k*th of these publications.
*µ~jq~* is the field reference value that the citation rate of *P~j~*,
*c~j~*, is normalized against regarding the *q*th subject category of
*P~j~*, and the normalization gives rise to a field normalized citation
rate for *P~j~* (cf. the definition of mean field normalized citation
rate above). (If *J~i~* is a non-multidisciplinary journal, *F~ij~* =
*F~i~*~(*j*+1)~ (*j* = 0, 1, ..., *p~i~* -- 1), since the number of
subject categories of a publication in *J~i~* is then equal to the
number of subject categories of *J~i~*.)[^2]

**1.4 Proportion publications in the 20% most frequently cited journals
in the field**

We define the *proportion publications in the 20% most frequently cited
journals in the field* for A, *jtop20%*(A), as

\(5\)

where *F~i~* is the number of subject categories of the journal, say
*J~i~*, of the *i*th publication of A, *r~iq~* the rank of *J~i~* in the
ranking of the journals in the *q*th subject category of *J~i~*, where
the journals are ranked descending after their mean field normalized
citation rates[^3], () the proportion publications appearing in the
journals--regarding the ranking of the journals in the *q*th subject
category of *J~i~*--with a rank less than or equal to *r~iq~*
(*r~iq~*--1).[^4] The rightmost factor in is the fraction of *J~i~* with
which *J~i~* is assigned to the 20% most frequently cited journals in
the *q*th subject category of *J~i~*. Observe that this fraction is
weighted by 1/*F~i~*, i.e., by the fraction of *J~i~* that belongs to
the *q*th subject category. The approach to assign fractions of journals
to the (for instance) 20% most cited journals is basically the same as
the assignment approach used in the definition of *ptop10%* (Eq. (3)).

# Part 2 Implementation at KTH Royal Institute of Technology

## 2.1 Database contents

The bibliometric database at KTH (Bibmet) contains the following
indexes:

-   Science Citation Index Expended (SCIE)

-   Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI)

-   Arts & Humanities Citation Index (AHCI)

-   Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Sciences (CPCI-S)

-   Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Sciences & Humanities
    (CPCI -SSH)).

SCIE, SSCI, AHCI from 1980 and CPCI-S and CPCI-SSH from 1990.

## 2.2 Document types included in calculations

In Bibmet, calculations are made for all combinations of document types,
publication years and Web of Science categories. However, the default
presentation of field normalized citation indicators concern only
articles and reviews. The reason for excluding other document types is
the risk for anomalies caused by a low number of publications in the
reference groups and question marks regarding data quality and citation
matching (this especially applies to proceedings papers).

## 2.3 Citations included

Citations from all records in the database are included in the
calculations. The indicators are calculated both with self-citations
included and excluded. The default presentation is made with
self-citations excluded, since the intention when calculating citation
indicators is to see what impact a publication has had on other
researchers than those who wrote the publication. Furthermore, one
should avoid giving incentives to systematic self-quotation.

## 2.4 Retroactive changes of the Web of Science subject category assigned to journals

If a journal is reclassified from one Web of Science subject category to
another by Thomson Reuters (TR), no retroactive changes are made in the
delivered raw data. However, in Web of Science TR changes the
classification retroactively. Changes of the classification affect the
field reference values and consequently the outcome of the calculations
described in this document. For Bibmet to be consistent with Web of
Science, retroactive changes of the Web of Science subject categories
assigned to journals are made in Bibmet.

## 2.5 Reclassification of journals categorized as Multidisciplinary in Web of Science

The large (in terms of publications output) and highly prestigious
journals Nature, Science and PNAS are classified by TR as
multidisciplinary. When field normalization is applied the
classification of these highly cited journals into the same category
results in very high field reference values for this \"field\". By
reclassifying publications in journals within the multidisciplinary
subject category according to their \"real\" topics the publications are
instead compared to other publications within the same subject field.
The Swedish Research Council has developed and applied a methodology for
reclassification of publications within the multidisciplinary Web of
Science subject category into other categories based on citations
(Gunnarsson, Fröberg, Jacobsson, & Karlsson, 2011). It enables a higher
degree of like-to-like comparison. The same methodology is used at KTH.

## 2.6 Exclusion of publication fractions with low field reference values

For all the four indicators defined in Part 1, publication fractions
with field reference values less than 0.5 are excluded.[^5]

**Example 2.1** (*mcf* and *ptop10%*). Assume that the *i*th publication
of A, say *P~i~*, belongs to three subject categories and that exactly
one of these categories has a field reference value less than 0.5
(regarding publications with the same publication year and of the same
document type as *P~i~*). For Eq. (2), *a~i~* in the denominator and in
the numerator are then multiplied by 2/3, and *q~i~* is equal to 2 (and
not to 3). Thus, the sum of concerns two field normalized citation rates
for *P~i~*, and the sum is multiplied by 1/2 (and not by
1/3)$\text{.\ }$

For Eq. (3), under the assumptions given, *a~i~* in the denominator and
the rightmost sum in the numerator are multiplied by 2/3, and *q~i~* is
equal to 2 (and not to 3). Thus, the sum concerns two ratios, both of
which are weighted by 1/2 (and not by 1/3). $\blacksquare$

**Example 2.2** (*mjcf* and *jtop20%*). Assume that the journal, *J~i~*,
of the *i*th A publication belongs to four subject categories. Assume
that for the *j*th publication in *J~i~*, say *P~j~*, published a given
year and of a given document type, two of the four subject categories
have a field reference value less than 0.5. For Eq. (4), 2/4 is
subtracted from the denominator of *jcf~i~*, and in its numerator is
multiplied by 2/4. *F~ij~* is equal to 2 (and not to 4). Thus, the sum
of concerns two field normalized citation rates for *P~j~*, and the sum
is multiplied by 1/2 (and not by 1/4).

For *jtop-20%* (Eq. (5)), under the assumptions given, two of the four
rankings in which *J~i~* occurs are such that *P~j~* does not contribute
to the mean field normalized citation rates of *J~i~* in the rankings.
$\blacksquare$

[^1]: Weights are used for the citation distributions at stake. Each
    citation value in a given distribution is assigned the weight 1/*k*,
    where *k* is the number of subject categories of the corresponding
    publication. The weight is the fraction with which the publication
    contributes to each of its subject categories. The proportion
    publications with less than *c* citations is then the sum of the
    weights for the citation values that are less than *c*, divided by
    the sum of weights for all the citation values in the distribution.

    each of its publications has a field reference value, with respect
    to the *q*th subject category of *J~i~*, greater than or equal to
    0.5 (see Section 2 below), with (1/*k*)*m* publications to the
    ranking, where *k* is the number of subject categories of the
    journal and *m* the number of publications of the journal.
