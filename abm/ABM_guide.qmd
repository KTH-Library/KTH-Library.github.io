# Guide to the Annual Bibliometric Monitoring at KTH

This guide gives an introduction to the Annual Bibliometric Monitoring
(ABM) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. The purpose of the guide is
to help you navigate the presentation of results, to understand the
bibliometric indicators used in the report, and to interpret the
results.

## Background 

The aim of the ABM is to assist monitoring, research evaluation and
quality assurance at KTH, but also to provide KTH organizations and
researchers with information related to their publications. The ABM was
introduced in 2013 and was published annually in the same format since
then. In 2019, a project aiming to redesign and develop the ABM was
started. This resulted in the current solution, maintaining the same
information as in previous years but in a more flexible framework with a
presentation that is more dynamic, extendable and easier to maintain.
That is the version of ABM described here.

The ABM results are available at different levels, for KTH in total,
Schools, Departments and for individual researchers. The report
currently has the same format and contents at all levels. Data is
presented for the last 10 years with a complete publication record, which
in practice means the year before last autumn and the nine preceding
years (i.e. in the spring of 2024, the ABM contains data for the
publication years 2013-2022).

Only publications registered in DiVA and affiliated with KTH are
included in the results (i.e. publications that KTH researchers have
published at other organizations are excluded). Affiliations to KTH are
based on the actual author affiliation as written in the published
paper. Indicators under Citation/Journal impact and Co-publishing tabs
are based on Web of Science[^1], and indicators are therefore only
presented for publications covered by Web of Science. Indicators
under the Scopus and SDG tabs are only presented for publications covered
by Scopus.

If a School or Department have changed name or the organizational
structure has changed, publications affiliated to old organizational
units have been assigned to the corresponding current unit when possible.

## Overview

The *Overview* tab includes key indicators displayed for the latest
available time period[^2] and general information about ABM and
publication activities at KTH.

Most numbers on this tab are based on fractionalized counts, i.e. an
author's share of a publication is counted as 1/n where n denotes the
number of authors. The exception is the *Co-publication* charts, which
are based on full counts.

Overviews at the KTH, school and department level are available to
everyone, except for the button for publication list download which is
only available for logged in KTH users.

The individual view, only available to the researcher, also includes a
link to edit publications in DiVA.

![](media/image2.png){.lightbox width=100%}

## Publications in DiVA

The *Publications in DiVA* tab shows the number of publications
registered in DiVA for the researcher or organizational unit, by year
and by publication type. Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus coverage are
also shown for each publication type. The validity of bibliometric
indicators is in general higher if the share of publications covered
is high. Results based on publications with a smaller share covered
should be treated with caution.

There is a tab for fractionalized counts and one for full counts.
Both graphs are based on the fractionalized counts table.

![](media/image3.png){.lightbox width=100%}

## Citation impact

The *Citation impact* tab shows citation impact for the
researcher's/unit's publications. All indicators on this tab are based on
fractionalized counts.

The first table in this view shows the total and average number of
citations after three years, i.e. citations received in the publication
year and the two directly following years, as well as the share of
publications that were not cited in that time. This table is
based on the Web of Science document types Article, Proceedings paper,
Review, Letter and Editorial.

The second table is based on the Web of Science document types Article
and Review, and shows Field Normalized Citations (Cf) and the
share of publications belonging to the 10 percent most cited in
its field.

The normalization is done so that the citation value for each
publication is divided by the average number of citations received by
publications from the same year, within the same Web of Science category
(or categories) and of the same document type. For more detailed
descriptions of the field normalized indicators used at KTH, see [Formal
definitions](https://kth-library.github.io/abm/Formal_definitions_field_normalized_citation.pdf).

Mean-based citation indicators (such as Cf) can be strongly affected by
a single publication (or a few) with a very high citation count relative
to its field, while the Share Top 10% indicator is less sensitive to
outliers. In that sense, Cf and Share Top 10% are complementary. 
Since field normalized indicators are unstable at low publication counts, the 
citation indicators are presented both as yearly values (dots) with a volume
weighted three-year sliding mean superimposed in the graph to indicate the
overall trend (solid line). Indicators based on a small number of publications
should still be interpreted with caution.

## Journal impact

The *Journal impact* tab shows the average citation impact of the
journals where researcher's/unit's have published their publications.
All numbers on this tab are based on fractionalized counts.

The table shows the average Journal Field Normalized Citations (JCf) and
the share of publications in the 20 percent most cited journals
in its Web of Science subject category/categories. This table is based
on the publication types Article and Review.

The JCf and Share Top 20% indicators supplement each other the same way
as the Cf and Share Top 10% indicators. By evaluating the impact of the
journals rather than the publications themselves, these indicators
supplement the picture of the publishing profile, and the journal
indicators are often seen as a proxy of the quality of publication
channels. JCf is also used as a part of the model for allocating KTH
funding to the schools.

## Co-publishing 

The *Co-publishing* tab shows the level of co-publication with
universities and other organizations. All numbers on this tab are based
on the Web of Science categories Article and Review and use full counts,
i.e. a publication is counted as one even if there are many co-authors.

Here, a Swedish non-university co-publication means a publication with
at least one address belonging to a Swedish organization outside
academia while an International co-publication is a publication with at
least two countries in the Web of Science addresses field.

![](media/image6.png){.lightbox width=100%}
The sub-tab *Countries and organizations* contains list of the countries and
organizations that the selected unit has co-published with, which can be
searched and filtered. These tables are also summarized based on the number
of co-authors on individual publications, to differentiate between smaller
collaborations and collaborations based on large author groups. The number
of rows shown can be selected under each table.

![](media/image6b.png){.lightbox width=100%}

## Open Access

The *Open Access* tab shows the OA status of publications according to
[Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org). For a publication to be included, it
needs to be marked as a peer reviewed publication in DiVA and have a
Digital Object Identifier (DOI) that Unpaywall can recognice and
determine an OA status for.

The statuses are presented as defined by Unpaywall. For further
information, see "[What do the types of oa status
mean?](https://support.unpaywall.org/support/solutions/articles/44001777288-what-do-the-types-of-oa-status-green-gold-hybrid-and-bronze-mean-)" at the unpaywall.org support portal.

![](media/image7.png){.lightbox width=100%}

## Scopus

The *Scopus* tab presents bibliometric indicator data based on the Scopus
database, as a complement to the indicators in the tabs *Citation impact*,
*Journal impact* and *Co-publishing*. This *Scopus* tab has sub-tabs each
containing data for one of these aspects. In *Citation impact*, the indicator
for field-weighted normalized citations is called FWCI, which is similar to the
Cf-indicator. The *Share Top 10%* is a direct parallell to the same indicator
based on Web of Science data.

Field-normalization for the Scopus indicators are based on the same principles
as the Web of Science-based indicators, but are based on the subject categories
in the Scopus database and supplied directly by Scopus.

![](media/image8_scopus.png){.lightbox width=100%}

## SDG

The *SDG* tab provides an overview of how publications are mapped against the
[UN sustainability goals (SDG)](https://sdgs.un.org/goals).

The mapping is provided from Scopus, and only publications present in the Scopus
database are therefore included in the summary. Publications are mapped to SDGs
based on search queries, using keywords found in titles, abstract and author
keywords, and the full methodology is described by Scopus
[here](https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/87txkw7khs/1).
The same SDG-mapping is also used in e.g. the
[*Times Higher Education Impact ranking* (THE Impact
ranking)](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/impactrankings).
Also note that individual publications can be mapped towards several SDGs.
