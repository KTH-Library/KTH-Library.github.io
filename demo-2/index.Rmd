## Background - previous demo meeting

Replacing the previous ABM (Annual Bibliometric Monitoring / Årlig Bibliometrisk Uppföljning).

- Project description

- Overview of old ÅBU

- Example apps and showing data flows

- Demo of possible additions

- Q/A and suggestions


## Suggestions and comments from previous demo

- Questions on the **bibliometric evaluation model** was raised.  
  $\rightarrow$ organization based  
  Evaluation of KTH-output and higher precision. Will add further **FAQ** to the ABM to answer common concerns and questions.
  
- Incorrect mappings and wrongly assigned publications  
  $\rightarrow$ based on school dialog and checks by researchers
  
- Clearer view of incentives and how publications contribute to impact  
  $\rightarrow$ E.g. list of top-contributing papers and journals


## Suggestions and comments from previous demo, cont'd

- **Data access** and exports were requested.  
  $\rightarrow$ We are developing **an API** (currenlty JSON data) and an R package which bundles "public" data (without requiring database credentials).

- **Data sources** were discussed, including possible additions 
  $\rightarrow$ We are testing Scopus data, to add this as complementary data (citation counts, Scopus coverage).  
  We also indent to add functionality to the R package, to provide access to relevant **open data sources** (e.g. Microsoft Academic, Altmetric, Google Scholar etc).
  
## Suggestions and comments from previous demo, cont'd

Some comments on KTH's goals and incentives with bibliometrics.  
This should be an ongoing discussion within KTH leadership and the schools, with input from bibliometric group.

## Demo of ÅBU 1.0 current products


- Many new features, updated presentation and testing
- We are getting ready to roll out work into production
- We will show some of the work from the last month

- R package "bibliomatrix" [open source, on GitHub](https://github.com/kth-library/bibliomatrix)
  - [documentation is available here](https://kth-library.github.io/bibliomatrix)
  - you can use it without requiring database credentials
  - embedded public data from ABM
- New reports/flexdashboards and shiny app
- API providing data access
  - can be used by other applications
- [Workflows](https://kth-library.github.io/workflow)

# Feedback

What are your impressions?

# Future possibilities

A couple of visual examples follow, involving use of open source based tools and visualizations that are web-friendly and responsive and interactive.
