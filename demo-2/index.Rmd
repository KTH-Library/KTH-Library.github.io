## Background

**Goal:** Replacing the previous ABM (Annual Bibliometric Monitoring / Årlig Bibliometrisk Uppföljning).

- Project description

- Overview of old ÅBU

- Example apps and showing data flows

- Demo of possible additions

- Q/A and suggestions

## Agenda

- **Feedback** to suggestions and comments

- Progress so far

- **Demo** of new ABM app  
  $\rightarrow$ progress towards ÅBU 1.0

- Future **possibilities** / examples

- Discussion

## From previous demo

- Questions on the bibliometric evaluation model was raised.  
  $\rightarrow$ **organization based**  
  Evaluation of KTH-output and higher precision. Will add further **FAQ** to the ABM to answer common concerns and questions.
  
- Incorrect mappings and wrongly assigned publications  
  $\rightarrow$ **based on school dialog** and checks by researchers
  
- Clearer view of incentives and how publications contribute to impact  
  $\rightarrow$ will add **sortable list** of top-contributing papers and journals


## From previous demo, cont'd

- **Data access** and exports were requested.  
  $\rightarrow$ We are developing **an API** (currenlty JSON data) and an R package which bundles "public" data (without requiring database credentials).

- **Data sources** were discussed, including possible additions  
  $\rightarrow$ We are testing Scopus data, to add this as complementary indicators (citation counts, Scopus coverage)  
  $\rightarrow$ We also intend to add functionality to the R package, to embed access to relevant **open data sources** (e.g. Microsoft Academic, Altmetric, Google Scholar etc).
  
## From previous demo, cont'd

Some comments on KTH's goals and incentives with bibliometrics.

> This should be an ongoing discussion within KTH leadership and the schools, with input from bibliometric group.

## Demo of ÅBU 1.0

- We will show some of the work from the last month
- Sprint 7 - added data, dashboards, API etc
- We are getting ready to roll out work into production

## ÅBU 1.0 products

- [Workflows](https://kth-library.github.io/workflow/#6)
- [Components are part of a platform](https://kth-library.github.io/workflow/#2)
- You can use the R package "bibliomatrix" [open source, on GitHub](https://github.com/kth-library/bibliomatrix)
  - [documentation is available here](https://kth-library.github.io/bibliomatrix)
  - you can use embedded public data without requiring database credentials
  - data will be updated with official ÅBU results
- New reports/dashboards and a shiny app
- New API providing data access

# Feedback

- What are your impressions?

- Do you think this can replace the existing older ÅBU reporting?

- Anything you'd like to change or add in the future?

# Future possibilities

A couple of visual examples follow, involving use of open source based tools and visualizations that are web-friendly and responsive and interactive.
