## Recap from previous demo meeting

- Questions and concerns regarding **the model** was raised. 

- **Data access** and exports were requested. 

- **Data sources** were discussed, including alternatives to existing data sources. 

## Actions

- In response to questions related to the ABM model, an **FAQ** could be developed to answer common concerns and questions about the ABM model and process.

- In response to questions related to data access, we are developing **an API** (to provide JSON data) and an R package which bundles public data (without requiring database credentials).

- In response to data sources, we plan to add functions to the R package which provides access to relevant **open data sources** (including from scopus, Microsoft Academic, Altmetric, Google Scholar etc).

## Progress since last demo meeting

- We're now on Sprint 6
- We are getting ready to roll out work into production
- We will show some of the work from the last month

## Demo of ÅBU 1.0 current products

- R package "bibliomatrix" on GitHub
- API providing data access
- New reports/flexdashboards and shiny app

# Future possibilities

A couple of visual examples follow, involving use of open source based tools and visualizations that are web-friendly and responsive and interactive.

## Altmetrics
