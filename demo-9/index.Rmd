## Agenda

- The **DAUF** project - "Datadriven Analys och Uppföljning av KTHs Forskning"

- Overview of available data sources for projects at KTH

- A demo of the **"KTH Publication Analysis app"** with projects data from CASE

- Your **questions and feedback**

# Background and progress {data-background=assets/bg/kth-6.png data-background-size=cover}

## DAUF - background and context 

Trend towards `r green("better overview of research outputs")` as well as `r green("integration of systems.")`

## Progress - What is new during Q1 2023? {data-background=assets/bg/plant.png data-background-size=cover}

- **Mobilizations of projects data from other sources**
  * CASE
  * SweCris
  * CORDIS (EU projects)
  * Other sources
  
- **KTH Publication Analysis app**
  * allowing exploration of co-publication and collaboration at KTH 
  * for ad-hoc research groups
  * rolling data
  * CASE projects data

# Data for projects at KTH {data-background=assets/bg/kth-5.png data-background-size=cover}

## DAUF and data about projects

- DAUF has been building bottom-up data consolidation and analytics for KTH, making links between Researchers <-> Outpus <-> Projects

- "Which projects are active? Which researchers are involved? Grant sizes?"

- What is a project, really? It is an amorphous concept:
  - Externally financed research activity, ie funders and funding exists?
  - Internal ongoing "project work" - internal (or not financed at all)?
  - A call which has (not yet?) been awarded financing?
  - A way to group publications and their authors together?

- There is no single "source of truth" for all projects at KTH
  - Data requirements depend on who asks the questions and for what purpose
  
## Data sources for projects

- Overview of available data sources
  - Descriptions of data sources
  - Data flows and access
  - Combining data sources for KTH projects

## CASE

- <Overview here - nr of records, update frequency, fields available, keys>

## SweCris

- <Overview here - nr of records, update frequency, fields available, keys>

## CORDIS

- <Overview here - nr of records, update frequency, fields available, keys>

## Other sources

- <Overview here - nr of records, update frequency, fields available, keys>

## Combining data sources for projects

- <Overlap - Unions and intersections for different data sources>

# Demo of KTH Publication Analysis app

## KTH Publication Analysis app

The goal of this app is to help answering some common questions, for example:

- <Bullet points to focus on ...>
- <...>

## KTH Publication Analysis app

- Screenshot etc

## Future work and directions

- <Product Owners, Future Outlook>
- Subject area analysis
  - UKÄ/SCB categories
  - Topic clusters and keywords
  - Journal classifications

# Questions and feedback

## Questions and Answers {.smaller}

Please provide your input!

- Do you think what was presented in the demonstration meets **your needs for analytical exploration**?
- Would **additional reference datasets** be needed?
- Would additional ways to **slice and dice** the data along other dimensions be useful?
- Would **parameterized interactive reports** be useful in addition to the raw data and the app?
- Are metrics related to **author sequence/order** useful?
- **Other questions** from the Zoom chat
- Suggestions and **comments**

If you prefer to provide written feedback, please use the following [jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1qJ9v6JyamDLPS82_qYg9l7scWkJcX8xVY0m6weazJCI/viewer)

Thank you for attending!
