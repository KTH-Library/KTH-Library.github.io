## Agenda

- The **DAUF** project - "Datadriven Analys och Uppföljning av KTHs Forskning"

- A demo of the **"KTH Publication Analysis app"** with projects data from CASE

- Overview of available data sources for projects at KTH

- Your **questions and feedback**

# Background and progress {data-background=assets/bg/kth-6.png data-background-size=cover}

## DAUF - background and context 

Trend towards `r green("better overview of research outputs")` as well as `r green("integration of systems.")`

## Related, currently at KTH

- DAUF
- Data office (in progress)
- More support and management of research data
- Project to replace HR-system


## Progress - What is new during Q1 2023? {data-background=assets/bg/plant.png data-background-size=cover}

- **KTH Publication Analysis app**
  * allowing exploration of co-publication and collaboration at KTH 
  * for ad-hoc research groups
  * rolling data
  * CASE projects data
  
- **Mobilizations of projects data from other sources**
  * CASE
  * SweCris
  * CORDIS (EU projects)
  * Other sources

- **ABM**
  * Sustainable Development Goals

# Demo of KTH Publication Analysis app

## KTH Publication Analysis app

The idea is that the analysis app will complement the *Annual bibliometric monitoring* (ABM).

The goal of this app is to help answering some common questions, for example:

- Who are the main collaborating partners to the division of Electric Power and Energy Systems?
- How large is the publication output of the department of Gene technology over time, in copublication with German organisations?
- Which senior staff at CBH is collaborating with MIT, and what is the bibliometric performance of this research compared to CBH baseline? 
- What is the publication output and project count of the staff related to a particular project (ad hoc group of KTH staff)

## KTH Publication Analysis app - example

## Example based on TECoSA

[TECoSA](https://www.tecosa.center.kth.se/) Centre running since 2020 used as example, based on 9 PIs.

Some summary stats:

- 462 publications 2010-2022
- 137 publications 2020-2022 (e.g. from the TECoSA-period)

- 28 projects in CASE
- 14 projects 2020-2021 (seems to be more in CASE, but some with missing data on duration)
- Info on funders and SDG-goals on projects
- Picture of collaborations, through co-publication

# Data for projects at KTH {data-background=assets/bg/kth-5.png data-background-size=cover}

## DAUF and data about projects

- DAUF has been building bottom-up data consolidation and analytics for KTH, making links between Researchers <-> Outputs <-> Projects

- "Which projects are active? Which researchers are involved? Grant sizes?"

- What is a project, really? It is an amorphous concept:
  - Externally financed research activity, i.e. funders and funding exists?
  - Internal ongoing "project work" - internal (or not financed at all)?
  - A call which has (not yet?) been awarded financing?
  - A way to group publications and their authors together?

- There is no single "source of truth" for all projects at KTH
  - Data requirements depend on who asks the questions and for what purpose
  
## Data sources for projects

- Overview of available data sources

- <font size="4">Descriptions of data sources</font>
- <font size="4">Data flows and access</font>
- <font size="4">Combining data sources for KTH projects</font>

## CASE

An internal project management system at KTH, mainly used by the schools and RSO.

```{r echo=F,out.width="60%",fig.align='center'}
# - <Overview here - nr of records, update frequency, fields available, keys>
include_graphics(path = "assets/img/Case-Overview.png")
```

## SweCris

```{r echo=F,out.width="50%",fig.align='center'}
# - <Overview here - nr of records, update frequency, fields available, keys>
include_graphics(path = "assets/img/sweCris overview.png")
```

## CORDIS

- <Overview here - nr of records, update frequency, fields available, keys>

```{r echo=F,out.width="60%",fig.align='center',fig.}
include_graphics(path = "assets/img/cordisOpenAire Overview.png")
```

- bullet p1
- bullet p2

## OpenAIRE (as separate slide)

X

## Combining data sources for projects

- <Overlap - Unions and intersections for different data sources>

```{r echo=F,out.width="100%",fig.align='center'}
include_graphics(path = "assets/img/testGraph.png")
```


## Selection (Urval)

- Case versus sweCris

  + In total, 203 unique projects can be matched based on ID, Title, and Primary Researcher.

```{r echo=F,out.width="90%",fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("assets/img/Table.3.png")
```

## Why the discrepancy?

```{r echo=F,out.width="90%",fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("assets/img/typebyyear.png")
```

## Ancillary results

```{r echo=F,out.width="90%",fig.align='center'}
# - <Overview here - nr of records, update frequency, fields available, keys>
include_graphics(path = "assets/img/Summary graph_new.png")
```

## Project data - discussion

- Do you have a need to follow-up projects from both the "contract" perspective and the "research subject" perspective?
- xx
- yy

## Future work and directions

- <Product Owners, Future Outlook>
- Subject area analysis
  - UKÄ/SCB categories
  - Topic clusters and keywords
  - Journal classifications

# Questions and feedback

## Questions and Answers {.smaller}

Please provide your input!

- Do you think what was presented in the demonstration meets **your needs for analytical exploration**?
- Would **additional reference datasets** be needed?
- Would additional ways to **slice and dice** the data along other dimensions be useful?
- Would **parameterized interactive reports** be useful in addition to the raw data and the app?
- Are metrics related to **author sequence/order** useful?
- **Other questions** from the Zoom chat
- Suggestions and **comments**

If you prefer to provide written feedback, please use the following [jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1qJ9v6JyamDLPS82_qYg9l7scWkJcX8xVY0m6weazJCI/viewer)
