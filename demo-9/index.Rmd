## Agenda {.smaller}

- The **DAUF** project - "Datadriven Analys och Uppf√∂ljning av KTHs Forskning"
- A demo of the **"KTH Publication Analysis app"** with projects data from CASE
- Overview of available data sources for projects at KTH
- Your **questions and feedback**
  
### About the project

- Collaboration within VS, between KTH-Library, RSO and ITA.  
- Agile model with 2 week sprints.  
- Creating services and tools for presentation of data, improved data flows and connecting data sources within KTH.

# Background and progress {data-background=assets/bg/kth-6.png data-background-size=cover}

## DAUF - background and context I

Trend towards `r green("better overview of research outputs")` as well as `r green("integration of systems.")`

# Demo of KTH Publication Analysis app

## KTH Publication Analysis app

The idea is that the analysis app will complement the *Annual bibliometric monitoring* (ABM), and answer questions like:

- Who are the **main collaborating partners** to the division of Electric Power and Energy Systems?

- How large co-publication output between is the publication output of the department of Gene technology over time, in **co-publication with German organisations**?

- Which **senior staff at CBH is collaborating with MIT**, and what is the bibliometric performance of this research compared to CBH baseline? 
- What is the publication output and project count for an **ad hoc grouping of staff** related to a particular project?

## Example based on TECoSA

[TECoSA](https://www.tecosa.center.kth.se/) (Trustworthy Edge Computing Systems and Applications) Centre running since 2020 used as example, based on 9 PIs.

- 462 publications 2010-2022
- 137 publications 2020-2022 (e.g. from the TECoSA-period)

- 28 projects in CASE - ‚ÄúCase Management System for Research Projects‚Äù @ KTH
- 14 projects 2020-2022 (seems to be more in CASE, but some with missing data on duration)
- Info on funders and SDG-goals on projects
- Picture of collaborations, through co-publication

# Data for projects at KTH {data-background=assets/bg/kth-5.png data-background-size=cover}

## DAUF and data about projects at KTH

DAUF has been building bottom-up data consolidation and analytics for KTH, making links between **Researchers** <-> **Outputs** <-> **Projects** <-> **Organisations**

<center>
![](assets/img/project-person-output.png)
</center>

"Which projects are active? Which researchers are involved? From which organisations? Grant sizes?"

## Definition of "project"?

There is no single "source of truth" for all projects at KTH. Data requirements depend on who asks the questions and for what purpose.

- What is a project, really? It is an amorphous/vague concept:
  - Externally financed research activity, i.e. requires that funder(s) and funding exists?
  - A call which has (not yet?) been awarded financing?
  - Internal ongoing "project work" - internally financed?
  - A way to topically group publications and their authors together?

## Tooling and components {.smaller}

<center>
![https://data.bibliometrics.lib.kth.se](assets/img/minio-kth.png){height=250}
</center>

### Tools
- ["kthcorpus" - open repo, publication and authors in DiVA etc](https://github.com/KTH-Library/kthcorpus)
- ["institutions" - open repo, organisation identifers etc](https://github.com/KTH-Library/institutions)
- ["bibliotools" - private repo, access to CASE data](https://github.com/KTH-Library/bibliotools)

# External data sources for KTH Projects - Overview {data-background=assets/bg/kth-1.png data-background-size=cover}

## CASE: a Research Management process in Edge

- Internal source at KTH (Efecte Edge) - a "Case Management System for Research Projects"
- Keeps track of agreements, contracts, legal documents
- Could be a good source for internally financed projects
- Can complement what is missing from other open sources
- Comparatively more diverse (project types, funding organizations)

## CASE (I/II) - fields and missingness {.smaller}

```{r echo=F,out.width="50%",fig.align='center'}
# - <Overview here - nr of records, update frequency, fields available, keys>
include_graphics(path = "assets/img/Case overview.png")
```

## CASE (II/II) 

- <font size="5">Encompasses projects that have received funding from 29 different agencies, covering a time frame from 2009 to 2024</font>

- <font size="5">Although information on funding organizations is available, it remains insufficient and requires improvement (e.g. 22% are NA)</font>

```{r echo=F,out.width="100%",fig.align='default'}
include_graphics(path = "assets/img/Case funding.png")
```

## Swecris {.smaller}

- There are seven funding agencies in Swecris
- Noticeably, the share of missing information of Primary Researcher and Leading role is moderately high, ca 20%

```{r echo=F,out.width="55%",fig.align='center'}
# - <Overview here - nr of records, update frequency, fields available, keys>
include_graphics(path = "assets/img/sweCris overview.png")
```

## CORDIS

[Synergies and Challenges of Integrating Heterogeneous KTH Project Datasets](sweCrisQo.html)

```{r echo=F,out.width="50%",fig.align='center'}
include_graphics(path = "assets/img/cordis overview.png")
```

## OpenAIRE

[Synergies and Challenges of Integrating Heterogeneous KTH Project Datasets](sweCrisQo.html)

```{r echo=F,out.width="55%",fig.align='center'}
include_graphics(path = "assets/img/openAire overview.png")
```

## Combining data sources for KTH projects

Overlap - Unions and intersections for different data sources
```{r echo=F,out.width="100%",fig.align='center'}
include_graphics(path = "assets/img/Dataflow-and-entity-graph.png")
```

## CASE versus Swecris - 174 exact matches found

```{r echo=F,out.width="100%",fig.align='center'}
#   + <font size="4">The use of orCid ID's returned 986 projects from sweCris of which 91 observations could subsequently be matched with Case based on a fuzzy-matching of research title.</font>
include_graphics("assets/img/Table.3.png")
```

## Why the discrepancy?

```{r echo=F,out.width="90%",fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("assets/img/typebyyear.png")
```

## Project data - discussion

- Do you have a need to follow-up projects from both the "contract" perspective and the "research area/topic" perspective?
- Define purpose and use data from the most relevant sources. Should CASE be used to complement other external sources? 

# Discussion, Questions, Feedback {data-background=assets/bg/kth-2.png data-background-size=cover}

## Future work and directions

Determined based on your input and directions provided by product owners.

- Subject area analysis in KTH Publication Analysis app
  - UK√Ñ/SCB categories
  - Topic clusters and keywords
  - Journal classifications
  
- Improved filtering
- Preliminary merged project list (based on CASE + external sources)


## Questions and Answers {.smaller}

Please provide your input!

- Do you have a need to follow-up projects from both the **"contract"** perspective and the **"research area/topic"** perspective?
- Do you have ideas for **additional reference datasets** that are useful for analyzing your projects at KTH?
- Would **parameterized interactive reports** be useful in addition to the raw data and the app?
- **Other questions** from the Zoom chat
- Suggestions and **comments**?

If you prefer to provide written feedback, please use the following [jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/17xE5Pxs339c3Teco5DeuTAaz9EbJGdtNQCI6u5lEW3o/viewer).
