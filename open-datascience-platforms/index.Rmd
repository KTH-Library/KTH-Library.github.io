## Open Data Science Platforms {data-background=assets/bg/kth-6.png data-background-size=cover}

The research community around the world increasingly use the "cloud" and "containers" to support reproducible data science research activities. 

- Researchers need "`r red("**data science workflows**")`" when working with data and publishing results
- Peer-review of research findings -> results needs to be `r red("**reproducible**")`
- Workflows increasingly involve open data but `r red("**also reproducible analyses (code)**")` 
- `r red("**Convergence**")` of HPC and interative web applications - running together on containers.

## Trends at FOSDEM20 {data-background=assets/bg/kth-3.png data-background-size=cover}

Several such "science clouds" based on open source platforms were represented at the FOSDEM track for [HPC, Big Data and Data Science](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/hpc_big_data_and_data_science/).

Examples: Compute Canada and Austrian BioCenter in Vienna

Trends:

- Converging HPC computing and interactive web applications through containers 
- JupyterHub + RStudio as web-based analytics front-ends and Apache Spark as data backend
- Open source with deployments "On-premise" and/or "in cloud"

# Canadian open science cloud

## {data-background=assets/bg/kth-4.png data-background-size=cover}

Compute Canada provides HPC infrastructures and support to every academic research institution in Canada. 

Researchers are provided with a complete HPC cluster software environment including a __Slurm scheduler__ (jobs), a Globus Endpoint (file sharing), JupyterHub, LDAP, DNS, and over 3000 research software packages. 

https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/magic_castle/

Compute Canada staff has been using this software to deploy ephemeral clusters for training purposes every other week for the past two years.

## Interactive applications on HPC systems {data-background=assets/bg/kth-6.png data-background-size=cover}

Exploratory data analysis has increased the demand for __interactive tools__. In the same way, workshops and other teaching events often benefit from immediate and on-demand access to preconfigured, interactive environments.

On-premise container orchestration is often preferable because it enables __deploying interactive tools on existing compute infrastructure__ that provides access to both software packages and the data to be analysed. 

The deployment on __HPC batch systems__ specifically brings challenges on how to handle authentication, user identities, and job submissions.

## Challenges for a researcher {data-background=assets/bg/kth-2.png data-background-size=cover}

Creating

- How can I as a researcher create reproducible open research results? Tools and support?
- What do I need to know - skills in "data carpentry" etc?

Sharing

- What does it mean in practice if the research funds requires me to follow FAIR principles?
- How do I deal with "personal data"?

__Who can help me out? __
__What are best practices and recommended workflows?__

## Non-open "platforms" {data-background=assets/bg/kth-4.png data-background-size=cover}

Within BI, existing commercial platforms are QlikTech, TIBCO Spotfire, Tableau, Cognos, SAS mm.

Downsides:

- `r red("__Vendor lock-in__")` and license managment requirements and costs. 
- Support for modern `r red("__agile workflows not built-in__")`, such as using GitHub Flow and reproducible `containers` (Docker Hub)
- Support for `r red("__reproducibility__")` is increasingly required in the frontlines of academic research, utilizing data science approaches using with R and Python for ML / AI. 
- Weak support for `r red("__Big Data / Fast Data__")` such as data analysis powered by Apache Spark

## Technical solution {data-background=assets/bg/kth-5.png data-background-size=cover}

Open source-based platform for reproducible research including web-friendly data analysis:

- Front-end for open data science [KONTARION](https://github.com/kth-library/kontarion)

- Can do __ML och AI__, scales locally or in the cloud using Docker Swarm / Kubernetes, container-based, supports ML/AI workflows using R, Python (Jupyter) etc... GPU-scaling and [slurm jobs](https://docs.rstudio.com/rsp/integration/launcher-slurm/))

- Backend for big data using [Apache Spark + Minio + Select S3](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eGahU6aR9GynYYyka2X-tTLSqLISEGvz7ZzfgfYq6Qw/edit#slide=id.g54b55e0426_0_0)
