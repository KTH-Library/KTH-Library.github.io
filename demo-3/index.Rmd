**Goal:** 

> Replace the previous ABM ie Annual Bibliometric Monitoring / Årlig Bibliometrisk Uppföljning at KTH

Our [previous demo meeting](https://KTH-Library.github.io/demo-2) was held 2019-12-05.

Since then (> __3 months ago__) we have worked on Sprints **8 to 11** (current)

## Agenda 

The [1.0 release is done](https://kth.se/abm), three releases have been published so far

- Progress - What is **new** since last meeting?

- A short **demo** of the ABM app

- Future **directions** after 1.0 release

- Our **questions** to you

- Your **feedback** and your suggestions and comments to us

## ABM 1.0

The first step of the project plan was a re-implementation of the old ABM. 

- More attractive and dynamic **presentation**
- Same results, based on **DiVA and Bibmet**
- `r red("New")`: Share of **uncited** publications
- `r red("New")`: Overview for **Open Access** publications
- `r red("New")`: Notes to help with **interpretation** of indicators/results

There is now a public version of the app showing breakdowns for KTH units. It allows researchers to login using their KTH account to view their own data.

# Live demo - ABM dashboard

## Open Access data in ABM {data-background=assets/bg/kth-4.png data-background-size=cover}

- Open Access status and category as determined by **Unpaywall**
  - Status: OA/Not OA. Categories: Gold, Hybrid, Green, Bronze
- Subset of peer-reviewed publications. Criteria: 1) Have a DOI number 2) Be identified by Unpaywall
- Two graphs for category distribution: overview, evolution in time

## Uncited publications

- In addition to the total and average number of citations, the number and share of uncited publications are included
- Uncited here means not cited after 3 years (the publication year and the two following years)
- The other end of "Top 10% cited"

![](screenshot_uncited.png){width=500 .hcenter}

## "Notes": Coverage and sample size

- The number of publications for the row with least number of publication in each table.
- A warning text if any row is based on less than 50 publications.
- Shows the Web of Science coverage for the row with least coverage in each table.
- Displays **poor**, **moderate** or **good** WoS coverage.

- For individuals, there is a general word of caution for everybody regardless of size or coverage.

# What is planned next for ABM?

## Next phase for ABM

We will now show some planned future changes:

- About tab
- Additional data sources
- More comprehensive co-publication information
- Collaboration networks

Please think about what would be **most interesting to you** in the short run?

## "About" tab

Currently:

- brief information in the **Overview** tab
- longer texts in [**Guide to ABM**](https://kth-library.github.io/abm/ABM_guide.pdf) and other documents linked from **Overview**
- technical documentation at [https://KTH-Library.github.io](https://KTH-Library.github.io)

More information needed, such as:

- Where do these data come from and when was it retrieved?
- What criteria were used to select which publications to include?
- Outside of the ABM, how is bibliometrics used at KTH?

  - Co-publication

- KTH Styling for R users: [`ktheme`](https://github.com/KTH-Library/ktheme) ... used for example to make these slides

# Questions and feedback

## Questions related to ABM 1.0

- Does the in-dashboard notes to assist in **interpreting indicators** in the case of low `n` help?
- Do you think the [**PDF Guide**](https://kth-library.github.io/abm/ABM_guide.pdf) works? Is it useful?
- What information would you like to see in an **About tab**?
- What do you think is **missing** in the ABM dashboard?
- Should the personal pages also include non-KTH publications?
- Should app data be static (yearly) or continuously updated?

# Thanks for your attention!
