## Agenda
  
- Why neo4j?
- Downloading and getting started
- What is CYPHER?
- Demo: Loading KTH data into neo4j
- Get started

## Why neo4j?

Some legacy RDBMS are poor at handling data relationships.

Often "rigid schemas" can make it difficult to add relationships connecting entities.

A graph database treats relationships as data, so you can add and query on relationships "as you go".

## Graph structure

A graph is composed of two elements: a node (or vertex) and a relationship (or edge). 

- Each *node* represents an entity (a person, place, thing, category or other piece of data).
- Each *relationship* ("edge") represents how two nodes are associated. 

This general-purpose structure allows you to model all kinds of scenarios.

## CYPHER vs SQL

See this [primer](https://medium.com/neo4j/neo4j-data-modelling-2982bd90aa0c). From SQL to Cypher:

    - Table to "Node Label"
    - Row to "Node"
    - Column to "Node Property"
    - Keys - use Business primary keys only
       - remove technical primary keys, keep business primary keys.
    - Foreign keys to Relationships
      - replace foreign keys to the other table with relationships, remove them afterwards.
    - No defaults / NULLs 
      - remove data with default values, no need to store those.
    - Clean up data 
      - duplicate data in denormalized tables might have to be pulled out into separate nodes to get a cleaner model.
    - Index Columns to Array
      - indexed column names (like email1, email2, email3) might indicate an array property.
    - Join tables to Relationships
      - join tables are transformed into relationships, columns on those tables become relationship properties.

## Downloading and getting started

For neo4j there are several components:

- a *server*, the "graph database" (can be extended with plugins/add-ons, like "apoc" and "GDS" etc)
- a *desktop client*, an environment for writing queries and working with data
- various *bindings*, making it possible to write and read data from R, python, databases etc

A customized container image for KTH can be found here:

- <https://github.com/KTH-Library/neo4kth>

## Loading data

Can be loaded from Desktop client, using bindings or bulk loaded on server.

Using R: https://github.com/neo4j-rstats/neo4r

Using Python: https://towardsdatascience.com/neo4j-cypher-python-7a919a372be7

Using CLI: https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-import-csv/  

## neo4j with KTH data

- `neo4j` can be used as a data processing components to meet specific needs for "graph analytics"

- similar to what `igraph` (Python, R) offers

- in this case using dockerized `neo4j` setup with `neosemantics/n10s`, `gds` and `apoc`

- CLI tools like `neo4j-admin` which allows bulk loading, using data provided from "diva" R-package

- Loading data from "object storage", in our case minio at bibliometrics.lib.kth.se

## Loading data w CYPHER

CYPHER; Load from S3 url (minio) and write to database using label "Issue":

    LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "http://bibliometrics.lib.kth.se:9000/bibliometrics/swepub-checks.tsv?Content-Disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22swepub-checks.tsv%22&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=librarian%2F20210421%2F%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20210421T123325Z&X-Amz-Expires=432000&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=464d66fa726500b7822674f19c2636aa56d2103ff2929cd5b55311063ecc6251"  as row FIELDTERMINATOR '\t' 
    CREATE (:Issue {result: row.validation_result, year: toInteger(row.publication_year), flag: row.flag_type, old: row.value, new: row.new_value})

    # inspect results
    MATCH (n:Issue) RETURN n LIMIT 25

## Bulk loading (larger data)

See `diva::neo4j_bulk_extract()` for steps required for bulk loading corpus data from KTH.

This provides the data files used by docker image `kthb/neo4kth` used in its [startup command](https://github.com/KTH-Library/neo4kth/blob/main/docker-compose.yml#L15)

## Next steps

Learning by doing:

- Install neo4j 
- Load some data
- Make a query
- List questions, needs, thoughts
