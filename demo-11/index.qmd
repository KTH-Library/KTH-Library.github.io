-   Status update for the **DAUF** project - "Datadriven Analys och Uppföljning av KTHs Forskning"
-   Short news about **ABM 2024** and changes in the **KTH Research Information** app
-   News about the POC for the **KTH Indicators** dashboard
-   News related to **data curation** (publications and projects)
    -   Briefly about the **data infrastructure** used
    -   Involvement in **GDP** (Gemensamma Data för Projekt)
    -   Using data from **OpenAlex** at KTH
-   Future directions and your **questions and feedback**

## About the DAUF project

-   Creating services and tools for presentation of **research information data**, improved data flows and connecting data sources within KTH
-   Agile model with **2 week sprints**
-   Collaboration between **KTH Library, RSO and ITA**

# Status and progress update {data-background="assets/bg/kth-6.png" data-background-size="cover"}

## Progress overview - since last demo {data-background="assets/bg/plant.png" data-background-size="cover"}

-   The yearly update for **ABM 2024** is being prepared and is planned to be released in Oct/Nov

-   New features in **KTH Research Information** app

-   POC for the **KTH Indicators** dashboard based on consolidated indicators collected from across KTH. The intended user group is KTH leadership and it enables comparing indicators across schools.

-   A new open data source with data from **GDP** (Gemensamma Data för Projekt) has been mobilized

-   The open data source **OpenAlex** (used in the Open Leiden Ranking) has been evaluated and efforts have started to map data in DiVA against OpenAlex and work has begun to enrich DiVA from this source.
