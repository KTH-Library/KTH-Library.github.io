## Agenda {data-background="assets/bg/notes.png" data-background-size="cover"}

-   Status update for the **DAUF** project
-   Short news about **ABM 2024** and changes in the **KTH Research Information** app
-   News about the POC for the **KTH Indicators** dashboard
    -   efforts at other universities
-   News related to **data curation** (publications and projects)
    -   Briefly about the **data infrastructure** used
    -   Using data from **OpenAlex** at KTH
    -   Mapping of Sustainable Development Goals
-   Future directions and your **questions and feedback**

## About the DAUF project

-   Creating services and tools for presentation of **research information data**, improved data flows and connecting data sources within KTH
-   Agile model with **2 week sprints**
-   Collaboration between **KTH Library, RSO and ITA**

# Status and progress update {data-background="assets/bg/kth-6.png" data-background-size="cover"}

## Progress overview - since last demo {data-background="assets/bg/plant.png" data-background-size="cover"}

-   The yearly update for **ABM 2024** is being prepared and is planned to be released in Oct/Nov

-   New features in **KTH Research Information** app

-   POC for the **KTH Indicators** dashboard based on consolidated indicators collected from across KTH. The intended user group is KTH leadership and it enables comparing indicators across schools.

-   Involvement in mobilization of a new open data source with data from **GDP** (Gemensamma Data för Projekt)

-   The open data source **OpenAlex** (used in the Open Leiden Ranking) has been evaluated and efforts have started to map data in DiVA against OpenAlex and work has begun to enrich DiVA from this source.

## Annual Bibliometric Monitoring 2024 {.smaller}

- Prettier publication list export
- Changed OA graph
- Enabled selection of number of rows for co-publication tables
- Some cosmetic changes

## News in KTH Research Information {.smaller}

[![](assets/img/RI_demo.png){height="300"}](https://analysis.sys.kth.se/bibliometrics/app/research_info){.external target="_blank"}

- "Get results" visibility
- Improved tables: Mouseovers, multiple selection filtering, filter indication at export, full strings at export
- Improved networks: Searching enabled, KTH profile colors
- Co-publication indicators similar to ABM

## POC dashboard for KTH indicators

## POC dashboard for KTH indicators

- Brief dashboard viewing
- Description of data collection process and "decentrialized" data at KTH

## Efforts at other universities

Attended workshop within BenchTech network
  - Members: TU Münich, ETH, EPFL, Virginia Tech, MIT, TU Delft, HKUST, DTU, PoliMi
  - Theme on institutional research, strategic planning and data insights within university administration
  
Examples:
  - Several presentations on modelling of student success and predictions on admissions and drop-off
  - 
  
Take home messages:
  - Most universities have a more unified data handling than KTH
  - Sometimes a mix of tools for regular reporting and dashboards and ad hoc-analysis.

# Data curation

## GDP

-   GDP (Gemensamma data för projekt) is an effort of a number of Swedish research funders to create a common data model for project data

-   Regular harvesting of data from the API is now available from object storage "minio" at KTH

-   We have participated in reference group for the GDP efforts in collaboration with partners, including Vinnova and other universities

-   R package has been developed with a client - <https://github.com/KTH-Library/gdp>

## OpenAlex

-   Research outputs from KTH in OpenAlex - We have started to evaluate OpenAlex as a data source

    -   Comparisons against DiVA, WoS, Scopus, BIBMET

    -   Data enrichment using OpenAlex

    -   R package has been developed with a client - <https://github.com/KTH-Library/openalex>
    
    -   Discussions with Sunet and other universities about common resource
