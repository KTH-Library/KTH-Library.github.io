## Agenda {data-background="assets/bg/notes.png" data-background-size="cover"}

-   Status update for the **DAUF** project
-   Short news about **ABM 2024** and changes in the **KTH Research Information** app
-   News about the POC for the **KTH Indicators** dashboard
    -   efforts at other universities
-   News related to **data curation** (publications and projects)
    -   Briefly about the **data infrastructure** used
    -   Using data from **OpenAlex** at KTH
    -   Mapping of Sustainable Development Goals
-   Future directions and your **questions and feedback**

## About the DAUF project

-   Creating services and tools for presentation of **research information data**, improved data flows and connecting data sources within KTH
-   Agile model with **2 week sprints**
-   Collaboration between **KTH Library, RSO and ITA**

# Status and progress update {data-background="assets/bg/kth-6.png" data-background-size="cover"}

## Progress overview - since last demo {data-background="assets/bg/plant.png" data-background-size="cover"}

-   The yearly update for **ABM 2024** is being prepared and is planned to be released in Oct/Nov

-   New features in **KTH Research Information** app

-   POC for the **KTH Indicators** dashboard based on consolidated indicators collected from across KTH. The intended user group is KTH leadership and it enables comparing indicators across schools.

-   Involvement in mobilization of a new open data source with data from **GDP** (Gemensamma Data för Projekt)

-   The open data source **OpenAlex** (used in the Open Leiden Ranking) has been evaluated and efforts have started to map data in DiVA against OpenAlex and work has begun to enrich DiVA from this source.

Changes in ABM 2024

- Prettier publication list export
- Changed OA graph
- Enabled selection of number of rows for co-publication tables
- Some cosmetic changes


## Brief ABM results for KTH

- Number of publications is consistently declining
- Citations indicators are slightly increasing
- Journal indicators on a stable level
- Small changes in co-publication patterns
- Share of Open Access publications is steadily increasing

## News in KTH Research Information {.smaller}

[![](assets/img/RI_demo.png){height="300"}](https://analysis.sys.kth.se/bibliometrics/app/research_info){.external target="_blank"}

- "Get results" visibility
- Improved tables: Mouseovers, multiple selection filtering, filter indication at export, full strings at export
- Improved networks: Searching enabled, KTH profile colors
- Co-publication indicators similar to ABM

## Work with KTH indicators & dashboard POC

## KTH indicators - background and process

::: columns
::: {.column width="65%"}

- Ambition at KTH to track visions and goals using indicators
- Project within *Strategisk verksamhetsanalys*
- Workshops to align avaliable data with goals
- Relatively manual data collection process from scattered systems at KTH
- Indicator report  + beta dashboard for testing purposes

## Efforts at other universities

Workshop within BenchTech network

  - Members: TU Münich, ETH, EPFL, Virginia Tech, MIT, TU Delft, HKUST, DTU, PoliMi
  - Theme on institutional research, strategic planning and data insights within university administration
  
Examples:

  - Several presentations on modelling of student success and predictions on admissions and drop-off
  - 
  
  
## Efforts at other universities - Cont’d


Take home messages:

  - Most universities have a more unified data handling than KTH
  - Often a mix of tools for regular reporting and dashboards and ad hoc-analysis.
  - Sometimes frustrating dichotomy between internal processes (slow) vs data and needs for analysis (fast)

# Data curation

## GDP

-   GDP (Gemensamma data för projekt) is an effort of a number of Swedish research funders to create a common data model for project data

-   Regular harvesting of data from the API is now available from object storage "minio" at KTH

-   We have participated in reference group for the GDP efforts in collaboration with partners, including Vinnova and other universities

-   R package has been developed with a client - <https://github.com/KTH-Library/gdp>

## OpenAlex

-   Research outputs from KTH in OpenAlex - We have started to evaluate OpenAlex as a data source

    -   Comparisons against DiVA, WoS, Scopus, BIBMET

    -   Data enrichment using OpenAlex

    -   R package has been developed with a client - <https://github.com/KTH-Library/openalex>
    
    -   Discussions with Sunet and other universities about common resource

# Data infrastructure
