# Status and progress update {data-background="assets/bg/kth-6.png" data-background-size="cover"}

## Progress overview - since last demo {data-background="assets/bg/plant.png" data-background-size="cover"}

-   The yearly update for **ABM 2024** is being prepared and is planned to be released in Oct/Nov

-   New features in **KTH Research Information** app

-   POC for the **KTH Indicators** dashboard based on consolidated indicators collected from across KTH. 

-   Involvement in mobilization of a new open data source with data from **GDP** (Gemensamma dataprojektet)

-   The open data source **OpenAlex** (used in the Open Leiden Ranking) has been evaluated and efforts have started to map data in DiVA against OpenAlex and work has begun to enrich DiVA from this source.

## Annual Bibliometric Monitoring 2024 {.smaller}

[![](assets/img/ABM_start.png){height="300"}](https://kth.se/abm/)

Changes in ABM 2024

-   Prettier publication list export
-   Changed OA graph
-   Enabled selection of number of rows for co-publication tables
-   Some cosmetic changes

## Brief ABM results for KTH

-   Number of publications is consistently declining
-   Citations indicators are slightly increasing
-   Journal indicators on a stable level
-   Small changes in co-publication patterns
-   Share of Open Access publications is steadily increasing

## News in KTH Research Information {.smaller}

[![](assets/img/RI_demo.png){height="300"}](https://analysis.sys.kth.se/bibliometrics/app/research_info)

-   "Get results" visibility
-   Improved tables: Mouseovers, multiple selection filtering, filter indication at export, full strings at export
-   Improved networks: Searching enabled, KTH profile colors
-   Co-publication indicators similar to ABM

## KTH indicators - background and process {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}

- Ambition at KTH to track visions and goals using indicators
- Project within *Strategisk verksamhetsanalys*
- Workshops to align avaliable data with goals
- Relatively manual data collection process from scattered systems at KTH
- Indicator report  + beta dashboard for testing purposes
- The intended user group is KTH leadership and it enables comparing indicators across schools

## Work with KTH indicators & dashboard POC

![](assets/img/kth_indicators_overview.png){height="550"}


## Efforts at other universities {.smaller}

Workshop within BenchTech network

-   Members: TU Münich, ETH, EPFL, Virginia Tech, MIT, TU Delft, HKUST, DTU, PoliMi
-   Theme this meeting on institutional research, strategic planning and data insights within university administration

Examples:

  - Several presentations on modelling of student success and predictions on admissions and drop-off
  - Modelling employment outcomes (PoliMi)
  - Semantic course mapping - find overlap/synergies (ETH)
  - Iterative development of gender diversity dashboard (TU Delft)
  

## Efforts at other universities - Cont’d

Take home messages:

-   Most universities have a more unified data handling than KTH
-   Often a mix of tools for regular reporting and dashboards and ad hoc-analysis  
    "*All money spend on people, not software*" - reason for open tools
-   Sometimes frustrating dichotomy between internal processes (slow) vs data and needs for analysis (fast)
-   Less emphasis on univ. rankings - more on data flows and analytics

# Data Curation

## Data infrastructure overview {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
### Object storage (S3)

-   An on-premise data lake is powered by [S3 storage using "minio"](https://min.io)
-   Data is curated and pushed to "minio" using automated processes to <https://data.bibliometrics.lib.kth.se>
-   Applications and data consumers can then read (and/or write) data there
-   See descriptions [here for available data](https://bibliometrics.lib.kth.se/RI_sources_KTH.html)

## GDP

> GDP (Gemensamma data för projekt) is an effort of a number of Swedish research funders to create a ***common data model for project data***. The five funding agencies **Energimyndigheten, Formas, Forte, Vetenskapsrådet and Vinnova** is developing a standard which enables sharing of open data about fundings and related information.
>
> The standard is developed in cooperation with a reference group including universities and other organisations within the university sector, KTH is a participant in the reference group.

## GDP data mobilization

-   We have participated in reference group coordinated by SUNET for the GDP efforts in collaboration with partners, including Vinnova and other universities

-   An R package has been developed with a client - <https://github.com/KTH-Library/gdp>

-   Regular harvesting of data from the API is now available from object storage "minio" at KTH: <https://data.bibliometrics.lib.kth.se/projects/gdp/gdp.db>

## OpenAlex

-   Research outputs from KTH in OpenAlex - We have started to evaluate OpenAlex as a data source...

    -   Comparisons against DiVA, WoS, Scopus, BIBMET

    -   Development of search criteria to capture all KTH publications

    -   R package has been developed with a client - <https://github.com/KTH-Library/openalex>

    -   Discussions with SUNET and other universities about common resource

## DiVA harvesting

The DAUF project now harvests DiVA publication data using the OAI-PMH protocol which regularly updates a single file [duckdb](https://duckdb.org) database, openly available from object storage:

<https://data.bibliometrics.lib.kth.se/kthcorpus/oai.db>

> The database with the harvested information is currently about 4.4 GB large.It is reqularly updated and contains MODS and JSON representations of "all-kth" DiVA records.

## KTH Theses Enrichment: Aurora SDGs

We illustrate enrichment of DiVA publications with an example where we associate SDG goals with all KTH Theses:

# Future work and discussion

## Future work and directions

-   Release of ABM 2024

-   Change source for research data to Swecris

-   Dashboard over company cooperation in student theses

Related activities

-   Strategisk Verksamhetsanalys

-   New data warehouse solution at KTH
