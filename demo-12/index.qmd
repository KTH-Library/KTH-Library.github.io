## Agenda {data-background="assets/bg/notes.png" data-background-size="cover"}

-   Status update for the **DAUF** project
-   New **ABM 2025** with overall result and updates
-   New beta version of **subject based KTH Research Information** app
-   News related to **data curation** - new version of DiVA coming
-   OpenAlex on Sunet
-   Future directions and your **questions and feedback**

## About the DAUF project

-   Creating services and tools for presentation of **research information data**, improved data flows and connecting data sources within KTH
-   Agile model with **2 week sprints**
-   Collaboration between **KTH Library, RSO and ITA**
-   Part of IT portfolio for Research (Delportfölj forskning), within in the object "Publicering och analys" 

# Status and progress update {data-background="assets/bg/kth-6.png" data-background-size="cover"}

## Progress overview - since last demo {data-background="assets/bg/plant.png" data-background-size="cover"}

-   This years version of **ABM** was released about a week ago

-   Recently released beta version of topics based **KTH Research Information**

-   POC for the **KTH Indicators** dashboard based on consolidated indicators collected from across KTH. 

-   Tests and prep for **GDP 2.0** (Gemensamma dataprojektet) - new standard for Swedish project data

-   Work to use OpenAlex to update DiVA, and to construct bibliometric database

## Annual Bibliometric Monitoring 2025 {.smaller}

[![](assets/img/ABM_start.png){height="350"}](https://kth.se/abm/)

Changes in ABM 2025

-   More interactive graphs (plotly)
-   Changed OA graph
-   Enabled selection of number of rows for co-publication tables
-   Some cosmetic changes

## Brief ABM results for KTH

-   Number of publications seems to have stabilized
-   Citations indicators relatively stable
-   Journal indicators stable but slightly increasing over last 5 years
-   Small changes in co-publication patterns
-   Share of Open Access publications sharply decreasing last year  
      - reasons unclear at the moment

## KTH Research Information - Topics (beta) {.smaller}

[![](assets/img/RI_subject.png){height="400"}](https://analysis.sys.kth.se/bibliometrics/app_direct/subject_ri)

-   Selection based on Web of Science Citation Topics
-   Three levels - macro, meso and micro
-   Otherwise similar to [KTH Research Information - Units](https://analysis.sys.kth.se/)

## Data Curation - overview

- Preparations under way for migration to a future **new version of DiVA**
  - Launch of new DiVA with API is postponed, and has **new timeline**
  - All **records need review** to meet new (not yet finalized) requirements
  - Updates are required for KTH curation tools and processes

- Broader discussions relating to a future **data lake for "KTH Works"**
  - Publication data mirrored in a separate system under control from KTH
  - Ability to cross reference other research outputs and auxiliary data from **external sources**
  - Revamp curation process - increase automation and **data enrichment** from external sources, sync to DiVA repository

## Data Curation and data flows

::::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
### Object storage (S3)

-   An on-premise data lake is powered by [S3 storage using "minio"](https://min.io)
-   Data is curated and pushed using automated processes to <https://data.bibliometrics.lib.kth.se> ("minio" / S3)
-   Applications and data consumers can then read (and/or write) data there
-   See descriptions [here for available data](https://bibliometrics.lib.kth.se/RI_sources_KTH.html)

## DiVA curation {.smaller}

The DAUF project now harvests DiVA publication data from KTH using the OAI-PMH protocol which regularly updates [duckdb](https://duckdb.org) databases, openly available from object storage:

- <https://data.bibliometrics.lib.kth.se/kthcorpus/oai.db> (Raw MODS in XML and JSON)
- <https://data.bibliometrics.lib.kth.se/kthcorpus/diva.db> (**Tables** / RDBMs format)

> The database is regularly updated. This is WIP and jocularly codenamed **"KaTHarsis"**

- Harvest of KTH works in DiVA now available as **relational database**
- Ambition to decouple importing and curation from DiVA in preparation for new DiVA
- Can curate and annotate works using this database, aka "stoplists"
- Preparations to use APIs to sync data between DiVA repository and this database

## Swedish bibliometric resource (OpenAlex)

![Demetrius](https://www.openalex.duckdns.org/logo.jpeg){width='100%'}

## GDP

> GDP (Gemensamma data för projekt) is an effort of a number of Swedish research funders to create a ***common data model for project data***. The five funding agencies **Energimyndigheten, Formas, Forte, Vetenskapsrådet and Vinnova** is developing a standard which enables sharing of open data about fundings and related information.
>
> The standard is developed in cooperation with a reference group including universities and other organisations within the university sector, KTH is a participant in the reference group.

## GDP data mobilization

-   Version 2 of the GDP API has recently been released. Tooling has been developed at KTH for harvesting data from the different sources using this version of the API, see <https://github.com/KTH-Library/gdp>.

-   Regular harvesting of data from the API is now available from object storage "minio" at KTH: <https://data.bibliometrics.lib.kth.se/projects/gdp/gdp.db>
