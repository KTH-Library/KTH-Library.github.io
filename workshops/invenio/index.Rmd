## Mini-hackathon {data-background=assets/bg/kth-6.png data-background-size=cover}

The first time we meet in this setting (first deep dive into DiVA/Inveno):

- Gaël Dubus, Anders Wändahl, Sam Al-Arbid, Nazar Dino, Markus Skyttner

Discussion points:

- When doing analyses of research outputs from KTH, what would be an ergonomic data flow?
- What system is most suitable as a primary/main data source for research outputs / publication metadata?
- What can data about research outputs be used for at KTH?

## What do we need for supporting an ergonomic data flow for analysing?

Depending on the analyst or user, different functionality is required:

- Researcher: Good Web UI for data entry for researchers, to maintain and update
- Analyst: APIs for system integrations and automatable workflows 
- Analyst: Toolbox / utilities for using and combining data in analysis
- ITA: Reliable components that can be adapted to workflows at KTH

## Main data source for research outputs -- currently DiVA

Current DiVA - future Invenio ... probably?

The current DiVA repository have some strength and present some challenges:

- Used nationally in many institutions
- API lacking, slow progress towards CORA (DiVA API v3)
- Difficult to extend for KTH specific purposes

## Future: Invenio

Invenio have some strengths in areas where DiVA does not:

- Invenio is similar to Zenodo, but more flexible, so known "globally"
- Good API, documentation
- Global community, actively maintained
- Extensible with custom fields
- Support for links / minted DOIs
- Presentation / GUI can be customized (can we make it look like DiVA, do we even want this?)
- Control over the data and the system, more empowered to quickly make adjustments
- Adapted by other institutions
- Comply to EU-standards for open data, a regional/global community

# Workshop #2 - Migrate DiVA to Invenio

## Tasks

- Migrate a few different records from DiVA to Invenio@KTH

  - Upload: Thesis, article, conference proceeding
  - Evaluate what is missing (for a specific usage / use case)?
  - Field mappings - Nazar has made a mapping for a complete view (including optional fields)
  - We could here first focus on required fields in DiVA
  - How to deal with missing values - a value is missing in DiVA, how will it be filled? 

## Pre-populating Invenio with "vocabularies"
  
- Pre-populating or "seeding" Invenio with "vocabularies" requires YAML for
  - Organizations (ROR and internal KTH orgs)
  - Names/People/Authors (creators)
  - Resource types
  - Funding
  - Subjects (FOS, CESSDA - controlled vocabulary consortium och european social sciences, MESH) - namespaced with a specific - SwePub requires UKÄ-classification (at least UKÄ, Scopus, WoS etc)
  - Users

## Discussion points

- Q: You can add, but you can not delete.... So a difference....
- Q: Are all "funders" pre-seeded/loaded - right now Swecris funders - ROR provides list of funders... and we can add Swecris and ... What are the DiVA funders....
- Q: How do we match DiVA keywords to controlled vocabularies?
- Q: For Swedish keywords UKÄ and possibly an European one
- Q: Is name variations possible to load? Investigate.
- Q: How would it be possible to use different UI views for different resource types for a) data entry b) curation.


## Migrating data from DiVA to Invenio

Description of the data flow / syncing process:

- We need to create 6 yaml files to load into Invenio ("vocabularies")
- We then can use the API to "batch load" and sync data from DiVA
- The UI could be customized to support "custom fields", see <https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/customize/metadata/custom_fields/records/>

## Example - migrate PID 1750711

Step 1: Some YAML and CSV files to migrate

<https://gist.github.com/mskyttner/8b4e559a21229e494585f0fdc7119868/edit>

Step 2: Create JSON and upload via the API

...

## Migration Plan {.smaller}

- Existing tools
  - Time to research and evaluate migration tools, for example...
  - invenio-rdm-migrator (from Invenio Software)
  - more?

- "Preseeding" Invenio from YAML files
  - Tool - CSV-to-YAML (possibly)
  - Load YAML files for affiliations/orgs, people/authors/creators, subjects, users and other "entities"

- Tool - CSV to JSON-file
  - Cleaning
  - Untangle mixed vocabularies...
  - Rate-limiting-call - can be managed individually
  - Quality control - checks for things like character encoding etc... and content
  
## UI - Data Entry and Curation in Invenio

- Investigate existing customizations, such as <https://infoscience.epfl.ch/>
