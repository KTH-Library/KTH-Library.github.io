## Background for ABM project

**Goal:** 

> Replace the previous ABM i.e. Annual Bibliometric Monitoring / Årlig Bibliometrisk Uppföljning at KTH

**Summary:**

Our [previous demo meeting](https://KTH-Library.github.io/demo-5) was held 2020-11-10. After christmas vacations we have worked on Sprints **24 to 31** (current).

**Netiquette:**

Please use Zoom, raise hand for questions, mute if not speaking, and think about questions to raise in the Q&A session towards the end.

## Agenda {data-background=assets/bg/kth-6.png data-background-size=cover}

- Recap from previous meetings - What **feedback** has been given so far in the project?

- Progress - What is **new** since last meeting?

- A **demo** presenting new work (based on 2020 data update)

- Update about **other efforts** (data integration, APIs etc)

- Your **questions and feedback**

## Feedback Recap

Mostly suggestions about steps forward, beyond the "old" ABM application

- One theme has been **Scopus data** and its inclusion in ABM

- Another theme has been about presenting **results at division level** in an author-based variant of ABM that focuses a "current view"

- Data integration against **other (non-WoS) sources** has been a reoccurring theme
  - Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, Semantic Scholar etc and ORCID matching
  - Coverage for conference proceedings in CS
  - Custom "divisions" with arbitrary researchers

## Feedback Recap (continued ...)

- Another theme has been ideas about new ways to interactively access, view and explore the ÅBU data
  - Data Quality and Curation aspects, for example for usage of HR / researcher data from KTH
  - Raw data access, APIs
  - Interactive Data Exploration functionality

## Progress - What is new? {data-background=assets/bg/plant.png data-background-size=cover}

- So far during Q1, we have focused on a `r red("updated data incl Scopus/Elsevier indicators for KTH")` 

- Another focus has been on providing an `r red("author-based report with output at divisional level")`
  - Based on HR-data for currently employed researchers and their publication outputs.

- Brief `r red("interpretation and comparison of results")` based on new data for 2020

- New `r red("Open Access report")` included - what does it say?

- Co-publication `r red("networks")` (KTH co-publication with other countries and institutions)

## Demo

  - **ABM updated with data for 2020**](https://abm.sys.kth.se/public/)
  - **Author-based ABM** (https://bibliometrics.lib.kth.se/beta/authorbased) 
  - Interpretation and comparison of **results**

# Demo

## HR/UG data for author-based ABM
  
  - What divisions are relevant (research-oriented)?
  - Understanding HR/UG data and "administrative divisions" versus "research divisions"
    
## Other efforts

- All efforts are available at [KTH-Library@GitHub](https://github.com/kth-library)

- A new R package [`cordis`](https://github.com/KTH-Library/cordis) provides data access to EU data for research projects.

- API and Static site generation for author-based ABM

# Questions and feedback

## Questions and Answers

Please provide your input!

- Do you think the what was presented in the demonstration meets your needs for Scopus data in ABM?
- What advantages and disadvantages do you see with introducing these additional dimensions into ABM (more data sources, author-based variant)?
- Other questions from the Zoom chat
- Suggestions and comments

Thank you for attending!
