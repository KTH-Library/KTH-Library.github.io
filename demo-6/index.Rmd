## Background for ABM project

**Goal:** 

> 1. Replace the previous ABM i.e. Annual Bibliometric Monitoring / Årlig Bibliometrisk Uppföljning at KTH
> 2. Further develop the ABM based on input from this group

**Summary:**

Our [previous demo meeting](https://KTH-Library.github.io/demo-5) was held 2020-11-10. After christmas vacations we have worked on Sprints **24 to 31** (current).

**Netiquette:**

Please use Zoom, raise hand for questions or write in the chat, mute if not speaking, and think about questions to raise in the Q&A session towards the end.

## Agenda {data-background=assets/bg/kth-6.png data-background-size=cover}

- Recap from previous meetings - What **feedback** has been given so far in the project?

- Progress - What is **new** since last meeting?

- A **demo** presenting new work (based on 2020 data update)

- Update about **other efforts** (data integration, APIs etc)

- Your **questions and feedback**

## Demo group feedback

You have provided many suggestions about steps forward, beyond the "old" ABM application.

Here is a rough attempt to summarize input since the project start into some themes:

- One theme has been **Scopus data** and its inclusion in ABM

- Another theme has been about presenting **results at division level** in an author-based variant of ABM that focuses more a "current view"

- User Experience improvements

## Feedback Recap (continued ...)

- Data integration against **other (non-WoS) sources** has been a reoccurring theme
  - Altmetrics, Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, Semantic Scholar etc and ORCID matching
  - Coverage for conference proceedings in CS
  - Custom "divisions" with arbitrary researchers

- Another theme has been ideas about new ways to interactively access, view and explore the ÅBU data
  - Data Quality and Curation aspects, for example for usage of HR / researcher data from KTH
  - Raw data access, APIs
  - Interactive Data Exploration functionality

## Progress - What is new during Q1? {data-background=assets/bg/plant.png data-background-size=cover}

- Data update with `r red("updated data for 2013-2019")` including RAE data delivery

- Scopus data integration added

- Addition of `r red("author-based report with output at divisional level")` based on KTH HR-data

- Brief `r red("interpretation and comparison of results")` based on new data for 2020

- New `r red("Open Access report")` included - what does it say?

- Other `r red("related efforts")` (non-app-specific)

# Demo

  - **ABM updated with data for 2013-2019**(https://abm.sys.kth.se/public/)
  - **Scopus** in ABM
  - **Author-based ABM** (https://bibliometrics.lib.kth.se/beta/authorbased)
  - Research-oriented divisions based on HR/UG-data

## Interpretation and comparison of **results**

TODO: revise and adapt this...

- How does results based on Scopus and WoS differ - beyond coverage? Explanation?
- Comparison organizational based ABM vs author-based - follow-up to previous comparison?
- What patterns can we see? Trends over time?
- Highlights and deviations
- Merging organizational units - how does it affect results?

## Other efforts

- All efforts are available at [KTH-Library@GitHub](https://github.com/kth-library)

- API and Static site generation used for deploying author-based ABM

- New python tools ['bibutils'](https://github.com/KTH-Library/bibutils) for Data Quality and Curation

- A new R package [`diva`](https://gita.sys.kth.se/kthb/diva) with Data Quality/Curation tooling for the KTH corpus (publications and authors)

- A new R package [`cordis`](https://github.com/KTH-Library/cordis) provides data access to EU data for research projects.

- A new data-only repository ['cordis-data`](https://github.com/KTH-Library/cordis-data), piggybacking on GitHub, using it for storing releases of versioned data publicly.

# Questions and feedback

## Questions and Answers

Please provide your input!

- Do you think the what was presented in the demonstration meets your needs for **Scopus data** in ABM?
- What advantages and disadvantages do you see with introducing these **additional dimensions** into ABM (more data sources, author-based variant)?
- What are the most important questions you think needs answering for [network style ABM data](https://www.vinnova.se/contentassets/07922986451f47ee865ff754707a4ab9/va-11-09.pdf) (co-publication, subject areas etc)?
