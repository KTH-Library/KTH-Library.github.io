## Agenda {data-background="assets/bg/notes.png" data-background-size="cover"}

- Status update for the **DAUF** project - "Datadriven Analys och Uppföljning av KTHs Forskning"
- **ABM 2023** - new Annual Bibliometric Monitoring snapshot
- New features in **KTH Research Information** app
- Progress in **data curation** including improved import procedures for publications
- Future directions
- Your **questions and feedback**

## About the DAUF project

- Creating services and tools for presentation of **research information data**, improved data flows and connecting data sources within KTH.
- Agile model with **2 week sprints**.  
- Collaboration between **KTH Library, RSO and ITA**.  
- New **research portfolio management structure** is taking shape, which the DAUF project is part of
- Several initiatives at KTH to track visions and goals using **indicators**, where the project can contribute

# Status and progress update {data-background="assets/bg/kth-6.png" data-background-size="cover"}

## Progress overview - since last demo {data-background="assets/bg/plant.png" data-background-size="cover"}

- New **ABM 2023** with [longer timelines and annual indicators](https://www.kth.se/en/biblioteket/nyheter/upptack-kth-s-genomslag-arlig-bibliometrisk-uppfoljning-abu-for-2023-1.1304850)
- New features in **KTH Research Information** app
- New **KTH graphical style** (across all apps and reports)
- New KTH-styled **quarto extension** with templates
- New **DAUF landing page** at <https://bibliometrics.lib.kth.se>
- Sunsetting of **staff-based variant of ABM** (replaced by Research Information app)
- Data flow integrations and new S3 data buckets established for data exchange (**Research Data / dmponline** and **Learning Analytics**)

## The big picture in ABM 2023

- Relatively **stable citation indicators** for KTH as a whole (at article and journal level)
- Slightly **decreasing publications volume** 
- International **co-publication stable** (not clearly increasing)
- **Open Access levelling off**, and variable between schools and departments 
- Quite **large variability** between departments

## KTH Research Information

[![*Copublication within KTH related to Fibre- and Polymer Technology, when publishing with organizations from Germany *](assets/img/kth_RI_kth-copub.png){width=950}](https://analysis.sys.kth.se/bibliometrics/app_direct/research_info/)

# Data curation

> **MORE. FASTER. BETTER. CHEAPER.**

## Publication data in DiVA and other sources {.smaller}

> KTH Library is serious about **data quality**. We now use more automated quality checks with fewer manual quality checks required.

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="45%"}

- Improved imports for publication metadata, where [**MODS** (Metadata Object Description Schema)](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/) is generated and ingested into DiVA using an automated process
- Improved **update frequency** and **data quality**
  - Faster and more frequent imports from Scopus
  - Better affiliations (from Scopus, enriched with internal KTH researcher identifiers etc)

:::{.column width="45%"}

## Reduction in manual curation time {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

### Time savings

- More than **50% time savings** in recent years

### Labour savings

- Automated record entry -\> **reduced workload** for the researcher

### Better quality

- Automated continuous **quality checks** and smoother **workflows**
- Cross-checking against more sources and using **enrichment** (ORCiD, affiliations)

## Other data infrastructure efforts

-   Efforts towards integrating data about **organisational structure** from HR, DiVA and "UG".
-   Better **ORCiD linkage** through more automated quality checks


![ORCiD crosschecks](orcid-check.png)

## Object Storage / S3 {.smaller}

Infrastructure upgrade with **server migration** finished, upgraded software stack with automatic certificates, updated monitoring endpoints. Includes software upgrade for **object storage** (S3 / minio) at <[https://data.bibliometrics.lib.kth.se](https://bibliometrics.lib.kth.se/RI_sources_KTH.html)> which improves on user management, provides SFTP support and more.

> Should we publish more "open data" (without Personally Identifiable Information) to support general use elsewhere at KTH?

## Tooling and libraries {.smaller}

A number of **new libraries** have been developed and existing libraries are continuously maintained:

-   ["kthcorpus" - open repo, publication and authors in DiVA, MODS generation, Scopus client etc](https://github.com/KTH-Library/kthcorpus)
-   ["openalex" - open repo, an R client for retrieving open data from openalex.org](https://github.com/KTH-Library/institutions)
-   ["reports" - private repo, various quarto reports from the Bibliometrics Team](https://github.com/KTH-Library/reports)
-   ["ktheme" - open repo, styling for making plots using KTH style](https://github.com/KTH-Library/ktheme)
-   ["kth-quarto" - open repo, quarto templates in KTH style](https://github.com/KTH-Library/kth-quarto)
-   ["bootswatch-kth" - open repo, Bootswatch (bootstrap) theme in KTH style](https://github.com/KTH-Library/bootswatch-kth)

# Discussion, Questions, Feedback {data-background="assets/bg/kth-2.png" data-background-size="cover"}

## Future work and directions {.smaller}

Looking more broadly, DAUF could evolve in several different directions:

- Centre and/or research **project overview**, also spanning outside of KTH
- Other source for project data (SweCris, Cordis ++)
- Support for recruitment processes (e.g. **applicant evaluation**)
- KTH **organisational overview** - linking data from different domains within KTH
- Other dashboards for KTH leadership, research quality processes etc.
- Including broader forms of **"impact"** in analyses and evaluations (open science, community engagement etc)
- Enhancing researcher **profile pages** (research overview, collaboration network)
  
Which ones do you think are most interesting for KTH, at this moment?
