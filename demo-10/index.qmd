## About the DAUF project

- Creating services and tools for presentation of **research information data**, improved data flows and connecting data sources within KTH.
- Agile model with 2 week sprints.  
- Collaborations within VS, between KTH-Library, RSO and ITA.  
- New **research portfolio management structure** is taking shape, which the DAUF project is part of

## Agenda {data-background=assets/bg/notes.png data-background-size=cover}

- Status update for the **DAUF** project - "Datadriven Analys och Uppföljning av KTHs Forskning"
- **ABM 2023** - new Annual Bibliometric Monitoring for 2023
- New features in **KTH Research Information** app
- Improved import proceedures for DiVA, and other progress in **data mobilization**
- Your **questions and feedback**

# Background and progress {data-background=assets/bg/kth-6.png data-background-size=cover}

## Progress overview - since last demo {data-background=assets/bg/plant.png data-background-size=cover}

- New **ABM 2023** with [longer timelines and annual indicators](https://www.kth.se/en/biblioteket/nyheter/upptack-kth-s-genomslag-arlig-bibliometrisk-uppfoljning-abu-for-2023-1.1304850)
- New features in **KTH Research Information** app
- New **KTH graphical style** (across all apps and reports)
- New KTH-styled **quarto extension** with templates
- New **DAUF landing page** at <https://bibliometrics.lib.kth.se>
- Sunsetting of **staff-based variant of ABM** (replaced by Research Information app)
- Data flow integrations and new S3 data buckets established for data exchange (**Research Data / dmponline** and **Learning Analytics**)

## The big picture in ABM 2023

- Relatively stable citation indicators for KTH as a whole (at article and journal level)
- Slightly decreasing publications volume 
- Stable level of international co-publication (not clearly increasing)
- Open Access leveling off, and variable between schools and departments 
- Quite large variability between departments?

## New in **KTH Research Information** {.smaller}

- New **branding** to conform with new graphical profile for KTH
- Improved **filtering** options
- Link out to researcher **profile pages** at kth.se
- Improved **export** functionality
- **Subject area** analysis
- **Topic clusters** and keywords
- **Journal** classifications
- **Open Access** tab
- Explore **co-publication** within KTH
- Improved **search** capabilities for finding researchers
- Data about **projects** at KTH

## KTH Research Information

# Data mobilization

## Publication data in DiVA and other sources

> KTH Library is serious about data quality. Now use more automated quality checks with fewer manual quality checks required. 

- Improved imports for publication metadata, where **MODS** is generated and ingested into DiVA using an automated process
- Improved **update frequency** and **data quality**
  - Faster and more frequent imports from Scopus
  - Better affiliations (from Scopus, enriched with internal KTH researcher identifiers etc)
  
## Data Curation for Publication Data

## Other data infrastructure efforts

- Efforts towards integrating data about **organisational structure** from HR, DiVA and "UG".
- Better **ORCiD linkage** through more automated quality checks
- Infrastructure upgrade with **server migration** finished, upgraded software stack with automatic certificates, updated monitoring endpoints etc

## Object Storage / S3 {.smaller}

- Software upgrade for **object storage** (S3 /minio) at <https://data.bibliometrics.lib.kth.se>
, using latest version which improves on user management, provides SFTP support and more.

> Should we publish "open data" (without PII) for general use elsewhere at KTH? For example ABM indicators for 2023, information about organizational units at KTH, information about projects at KTH etc?

## Tooling and libraries {.smaller}

A number of **new libraries** have been developed and existing libraries are continuously maintained:

- ["kthcorpus" - open repo, publication and authors in DiVA, MODS generation, Scopus client etc](https://github.com/KTH-Library/kthcorpus)
- ["openalex" - open repo, an R client for retrieving open data from openalex.org](https://github.com/KTH-Library/institutions)
- ["reports" - private repo, various quarto reports from the Bibliometrics Team](https://github.com/KTH-Library/reports) 
- ["ktheme" - open repo, styling for making plots using KTH style](https://github.com/KTH-Library/ktheme) 
- ["kth-quarto" - open repo, quarto templates in KTH style](https://github.com/KTH-Library/kth-quarto)
- ["bootswatch-kth" - open repo, Bootswatch (bootstrap) theme in KTH style](https://github.com/KTH-Library/bootswatch-kth)

# Discussion, Questions, Feedback {data-background=assets/bg/kth-2.png data-background-size=cover}

## Future work and directions

Determined based on your input and directions provided by product owners.

- ÅBU: Finns några små ändringar som kulle underlätta mycket? Någon som saknas

## Possible directions

Looking more broadly, DAUF could look in several different directions, e.g.:

- Researcher profiles (research overview, collaboration network)
- Centre and/or research project overview, also spanning outside of KTH
- Support for recruitment processes (e.g. applicant evaluation)
- KTH organization overview - linking data from different domains
- Including broader forms of "impact" in analyses and evalutions (open science, community engagement etc)
  
Which ones do you think are more interesting for KTH, at this moment?
