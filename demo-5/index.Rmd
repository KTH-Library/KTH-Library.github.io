## Background 

**Goal:** 

> Replace the previous ABM i.e. Annual Bibliometric Monitoring / Årlig Bibliometrisk Uppföljning at KTH

**Summary:**

Our [previous demo meeting](https://KTH-Library.github.io/demo-4) was held 2020-05-26. After summer vacations we have worked on Sprints **17 to 23** (current).

The [ABM services at KTH](https://kth.se/abm) have been operational since the last demo meeting, with some maintenance and updates during autumn, for example involving server upgrades and rotation of certificates.

## Agenda {data-background=assets/bg/kth-6.png data-background-size=cover}

> *Please use the Zoom chat for questions*

- Progress - What is **new** since last meeting?

- A short **demo** of the current work

- Update about **data integration** (Scopus etc)

- Update about **other efforts** (API for public data from ABM etc)

- Your **questions and feedback**, suggestions and comments

- Future **directions**

## What is new? {data-background=assets/bg/plant.png data-background-size=cover}

- During the autumn, we have primarily focused on a `r red("proof of concept for author based")` reporting showing results at divisional level, based on currently employed researcher and their publication outputs.

- Data integration work has been initiated with regards to using `r red("Scopus data")` from Elsevier in order to complement the WoS data.

## Demo

  - Introduction to **current ABM** for new attendees
  - Background for new **author based POC** (Proof Of Concept) 
  - Demonstration of author based reporting for KTH divisions
    - Examples
      - A few **divisions**
      - Two **departments** (sv. institutioner) versus current ABM
    - Some observations and explanations of differences


## Author based selection of publications

- Organization based = affiliation when publication was written
  - Usually used for reporting etc
- Author based = current affiliation of the publication's authors
  - Usually used for prospective analysis, current "brain power"
- Aim in this case is still reporting
  - Using only KTH publications
  - Fetch employees from HR system and collect their publications

## Divisions

  - [Overview for KTH Divisions](abm_divisions.html)
  
  - Examples
    - DIVISION OF ELECTRIC POWER AND ENERGY SYSTEMS: ["j/jj/jjn"](j_jj_jjn.html)
    - DIVISION OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: ["j/jh/jhs"](j_jh_jhs.html)
    - DIVISION OF SPACE AND PLASMA PHYSICS: ["j/jj/jje"](j_jj_jje.html)
    - NUCLEAR ENGINEERING: ["s/sh/shh"](s_sh_shh.html)
    - MATERIALS AND NANOPHYSICS: ["s/sk/skq"](s_sk_skq.html)
    
## Comparing departments

  - Examples
    - Electrical engineering: ["j/jj"](j_jj.html)
    - Computer Science: ["j/jh"](j_jh.html)
    - Applied Physics: ["s/sk"](s_sk.html)

## Scopus data integration

- **Scopus data** from Elsevier has been acquired 
  - Comparison of coverage versus WoS; [download here](Coverage.xlsx)
  - Plans to integrate in existing ABM/ÅBU app as complement to WoS

## WoS vs Scopus (Peer-reviewed) {.smaller}

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

    mutate(peerreviewed = FALSE)
)

dt1 <- fdt(d2)
dt2 <- fdt(d3)

```

```{r}
dt1
```

## Other efforts

- Further use of [`kthapi` R package](https://github.com/KTH-Library/kthapi) has been the basis for the POC

- A new R package [`semanticscholar`](https://github.com/KTH-Library/semanticscholar) allows for experimenting with data integration against this data source which provides open data for publications from many researchers at KTH.

- API for public data from ABM
  - https://bibliometrics.lib.kth.se/testapi

## Operations and maintenance

- we have separated operational ABM services from other **KTHB Bibliometrics services** and have allowed external users without KTH accounts to log in via the use of auth0

- we have initiated a **migration away from Travis** - a continuous integration service provider - to using GitHub Actions.

- we have **upgraded** the software stack and server environment (and rotated certificates and API keys)

- we have continued to work with the KTH Web team on aligning with the **KTH style** for web applications
