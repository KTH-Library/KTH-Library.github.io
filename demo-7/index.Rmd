## Background for this meeting 

**Aim**

- To show previous examples of co-publication data
- To discuss needs and use-cases that should be covered by an application

**About the project** 

In the ABM-project, we have had [previous demo meetings](https://KTH-Library.github.io/demo-6), the latest at 2021-03-25.  
The project is working by an agile model with 2 week sprints.  
From this summer the project has worked with a wider scope, to include more data sources and data flows.


## Copublications app

**Goal:** 

> 1. Present co-publication from KTH through an interactive app
> 2. Answer frequently posed questions related to networks of KTH publications
> 3. Allow the ability to view data at different organization levels and at author-name level<br/><br/><br/>...
> 4. Automate and simplify analysis


# Current ABM {.section_alt}
