## Agenda {data-background=assets/bg/kth-6.png data-background-size=cover}

- The **DAUF** project - "Datadriven Analys och Uppföljning av KTHs Forskning"

- Quick overview of some existing DAUF services/apps

- A demo of the **data curation tool** for DiVA publication and author data

- Update about **other efforts** (data consolidation and integration etc)

- A demo of the **"KTH Publication Analysis app"**

- Your **questions and feedback**

# Background and progress

## DAUF - background and context 

Trend towards `r green("better overview of research outputs")` as well as `r green("integration of systems")`.

## DAUF - data curation

</div>

- Researchers <-> Outputs <-> Projects

- DAUF has been building bottom-up data consolidation and analytics for KTH

## Projects at KTH

Data sources need to support questions like:

- Which projects are active? Which researchers are involved? Size?

- Agresso data may not be suitable for this purpose, 

    - investigating alternatives, e.g. SweCris & Cordis.
    - current lack of data coordination at KTH

## Progress - What is new during Q1 2022? {data-background=assets/bg/plant.png data-background-size=cover}

- KTH Publication Analysis app 
  * allowing exploration of co-publication and collaboration at KTH 
  * for ad-hoc research groups
  * rolling data (more up to date)
  
Example: The ECO2 research groups' output

# Curation tool for DiVA data

## Curation tool for DiVA data

- Tool for ongoing curation of research output data (publications, authors)
- Aiming at interoperable data with good quality

## Report for KTH publication corpus

## Data curation tools and data used

Data extracts can be copy/pasted from reports. There are other options, too:

- Downloads from [object storage (S3)](https://data.bibliometrics.lib.kth.se)

- [Curator API](https://bibliometrics.lib.kth.se/curator/__docs__/) (authenticated)

- [Checks API](https://bibliometrics.lib.kth.se/qc/__docs__/) (partly authenticated)

# Demo of KTH Publication Analysis app

## KTH Publication Analysis app

The goal of this app is to help answering some common questions, for example

- What does KTH collaboration with country X or university Y look like?
  * What is the bibliometric impact of this collaboration?

- What is the collaboration pattern and bibliometric impact of...
  * a KTH department, based on Diva affiliations?
  * staff currently or recently employed by some department or division?
  * some group at KTH not clearly defined in Diva or staff catalogue?
  * all the Postdocs at school Z?

# Questions and feedback

## Questions and Answers

Please provide your input!

- Do you think the what was presented in the demonstration meets your needs for more analytical exploration for **collaboration and co-publication** at KTH?
- **Other questions** from the Zoom chat
- Suggestions and **comments**
