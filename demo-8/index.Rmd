## Bibliometric Analytics app

The goal of this app is to help answering some common questions, for example

- What does KTH collaboration with country X or university Y look like?
  * What is the bibliometric impact of this collaboration?

- What is the collaboration pattern and bibliometric impact of...
  * a KTH department, based on Diva affiliations?
  * staff currently or recently employed by some department or division?
  * some group at KTH not clearly defined in Diva or staff catalogue?
  * all the Postdocs at school Z?
