## Background & DAUF-project {data-background=assets/bg/kth-6.png data-background-size=cover}

The **DAUF** project - "Datadriven Analys och Uppföljning av KTHs Forskning"
  
- Started with project to develop/refresh the the [*Annual bibliometric monitoring*](https://kth.se/abm) (ABM/ÅBU)
- Collaboration between KTH Library and IT
- Presentation of KTH research output  
   Started from bibliometric data
- Collation of relevant data sources at KTH  
    Publications, staff/HR, projects ...
- Servers and data layers
  
## Apps and services

- [*Annual bibliometric monitoring*](https://kth.se/abm) (ABM/ÅBU)
- Data curation tool for DiVA publication data
- Publication analysis (++)
- R-packages to interact with KTH-relevant data (kthcorpus, kthapi, ktheme etc, found at [Github](https://github.com/KTH-Library))
- Some APIs

## The analysis app

Allows for analysis of (some dimensions) of research output

Under active development and deployed on local servers, at: https://analysis.sys.kth.se/bibliometrics/app/publ_analysis

 - Organization view (used in ABM) and staff-based view
 - Ad-hoc groups or staff categories
 - "Live" data
 - Co-publication and bibliometric performance
 - Filtering
 - Project data (currently from CASE)
    * Added yesterday!

## Demo of TECoSA

[TECoSA](https://www.tecosa.center.kth.se/) used as example, based on 9 PIs  
Centre running since 2020.

Some summary stats:

- 619 publications 2010-2021
- 96 publications 2020-2021 (e.g from the TECoSA-period)

- 39 projecs in CASE
- 13 projects 2020-2021 (seems to be more in CASE, but some with missing data on duration)

## To-do and limitations

**To-do:**

- Adding filters for projects
- Adding subject categorisation (publications)
- More journal info

**Limitations:**

- Only based on KTH researchers
- Limitations in project data at KTH 
  * Only PIs
  * Limited economic data, and uneven quality among schools
  * System not originally created for project management in a broader sense
- Co-publication data and bibliometrics currently based on Web of Science

## Take-away

* Can catch centres and research groups, by ad-hoc selection and saved groups
* Unified view of publications, staff and project data (to some extent)
* Can help in reporting and monitoring(?)
* Can be used to better understand project groups
